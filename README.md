# fdf - Visualizing “iron wire” meshing in 3D.

The aim of this project was to take a file as input, and draw a 3D visualization into a graphic window based on that file.

For example, giving the following text as input:
```
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  0 10 10  0  0 10 10  0  0  0 10 10 10 10 10  0  0  0
