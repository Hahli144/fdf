# fdf - Visualizing “iron wire” meshing in 3D.

The aim of this project was to take a file as input, and draw a 3D visualization into a graphic window based on that file.

# Features
* Full 3D rotation

* Camera movement

* Altitude controls

* Colors according to altitude

* Zoom in/out

* Idle animation

* Parallel/Isometric projection

Relevant information, such as rotation degrees and instructions, can be toggled on-screen with the 'H' key.


For example, giving the following text as input:
```
0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
